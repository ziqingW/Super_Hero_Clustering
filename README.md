# Super_Hero_Clustering
## Introduction
This project is to distribute comic super heroes into different clusters based on their abilities using machine learning. It can be divided into two parts.  
* Part 1: Using cosine similarity to find out the most similar hero for the input one based on the abilities.  
* Part 2: Clustering heroes into different groups by KMeans method.  

## Data  
**Data Source:**  
https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set#super_hero_powers.csv  
This data was scraped from <a href='https://www.superherodb.com/'>SuperHeroDb</a> and was collected in June/2017 from superherodb which  had not been updated since, so it may not be up to date.  

Data example:  
<img src='Data_example.png' alt='screenshot for data example' title='data example' width=600px height=400px>  

Data summary:  
668 x 168  (668 heroes and 168 types of abilities)  

**Although the columns are already in one-hot style, the values are 'True/False' in String, which need to be converted into 1 or 0 for the convenience of future analysis.**  

## Methodology  
**I.  Data preprocessing**  


**II. Building the model in Keras**
